# Library-Automation-System
This project is built to enhance the efficiency of a library in current scenario the library management is automatic but the library staff still has to spend a lot of time in issue and return of the books so this solution is totally different from the current system this project not only provides the facility of computer based issue and return as well as no librarian is needed to issue and return the books for the members. The past works done in this fields are RFID based library system in which each book has a RFID tag so that staff donâ€™t have to enter Book number they only scan the RFID no and do entries we have extended the existing solution and built the self-issue and return service.
